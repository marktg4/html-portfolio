<h1>Mark's Favorite Movies</h1>
<h2>My opinion (as of right now)</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Coach Carter</h3>
<p>Shoe-in for my favorite sports movie. I grew up with it and I think it's easy to get behind the coach's beliefs despite the adversity.</p>
<h3>Lord of the Rings</h3>
<p>My nerdy pick of choice, and I can't even decide which of the original 3 I like the best. Huge childhood nostalgia, great action, great soundtrack, and still holds up today.</p>
<h3>Shutter Island</h3>
<p>A more recent favorite. I love the mystery of it. You are constantly thinking about what's up with the island as the movie progresses, and after the ending, you want to rewatch it again.</p>
